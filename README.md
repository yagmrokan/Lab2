Problem 1: This program processes 5 float numbers and 5 integer numbers entered by the user. It calculates and prints the average of the float numbers and the average of the integer numbers, both displayed with exactly two decimal places. The program also computes the sum of the integer numbers, checking if the sum is even or odd, and prints an appropriate message. Similarly, it calculates the sum of the float numbers and evaluates whether the sum is greater than, less than, or equal to 45.5, printing corresponding messages. The program ensures clear, user-friendly outputs while maintaining precision in calculations.

Problem 2: This program continuously asks the user to input a single printable character and then displays both the character and its corresponding ASCII value. The program uses only while loops to implement the functionality. After processing the input, it asks the user whether they want to repeat the process. If the user enters Y or y, the program restarts; otherwise, it terminates. All operations and prompts are handled in a loop to comply with the criteria.

Problem 3: This program prompts the user to input the size of a box and then prints a hollow box pattern of stars based on the input size. The pattern consists of stars (*) forming the border of the box, with spaces inside. The program uses nested loops to generate the rows and columns of the box. After completing the box, the program terminates.
